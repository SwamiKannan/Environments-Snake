I have been trying to build custom environments for RL learning which gives an agent better observations/ states that are not just a bunch of pixels. In this endeavour, I have created this Snake environment

This is just a readymade game to play manually. I intend to update this as a proper Gym environment soon

### How to play
Run 
```
python main.py
```
